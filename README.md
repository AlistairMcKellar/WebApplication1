I'd been playing around with Jasmine, knockout and requirejs with TDD/BDD (whatever you prefer to call it).  And had been puzzling on how to test an a computable value was correctly working when a get was done.

In the end I realised that the spyOn function callFake would let me do that and here it is.  More so I have a place I can review this but if anyone stumbles onto it and finds it handy cool.
